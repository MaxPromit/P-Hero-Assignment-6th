        <h3 class="mb-3">1.Difference Between Var, Let, Const</h3>
        <p class="w-50 mb-3">The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include:
            Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
            Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
            Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to the immediate enclosing block.The const keyword follows the same rules as the let keyword. The only difference with const is that const is used to define only constant values in JavaScript programs.</p>

            <h3 >2.Difference Between Map, ForEach, Filter, Find</h3>
            <p class="w-50 mb-3"><strong>Map</strong> executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.<strong>Filter</strong> checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria. <strong>ForEach</strong> is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. <strong>Find</strong> method returns the value of the first element that passes a test
                <h3> 3.Difference Between Arrow Function And Regular Function</h3>
                <p class="w-50 mb-3">The first and most obvious difference between arrow functions and regular functions is their syntax. Not only do they look different, but arrow functions also provide an implicit return shorthand and allow parenthesis around a single argument to be omitted.Inside a regular function, execution context (i.e. the value of this) is dynamic. This means that the value of this depends on how the function was invoked (simple invocation, method invocation, indirect invocation or constructor invocation). On the other hand, an arrow function does not define its own execution context. This results in an arrow function's this being resolved lexically (i.e. the scope in which the arrow function was defined).</p>

                <h3>4.Why We Use Template Literals</h3>
                <p class="mb-3 w-50">
                    Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, for string interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called tagged templates.Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.
